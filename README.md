# codeigniter_demo
simple application

Have created a database and a single table in xampp

database name : 'ci_test'

table name: 'category'

category table columns:

id(int),
name,
desription,
entered_date(timestamp).

functionality:

users.php -> controller
users_model.php -> model
access link in my machine -> http://localhost/sumit/index.php/users   
        sumit -> name of the folder in which i have dumbed all my codeigniter file
        
        
note: crude functionality is implemented except the update functionality.
In update functionality I am facing some minor issues for eg, my url is not  getting proper.
Also when i am editing the form i am getting the existing values properly but while posting the form i am getting error as 'variable id not defined',this variable id is the same thing which i have used for the retrival purpose.
